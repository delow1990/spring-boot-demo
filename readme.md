**Simple application showcasing fast prototyping and development of microservice application via SpringBoot**

The goal of this small project is showcase how much power SpringBoot provides with so little needed from developer.

This project was created by using [Spring Initializer](https://start.spring.io/) (actually, by using built in Intellij Idea support for it).

It uses WebFlux for reactive-oriented programming with embedded netty as server, consists of 2 manually written simple classes and 1 configuration property, and yet provides production-ready (well, almost) metrics out-of-the-box.

Simple, but powerful.
